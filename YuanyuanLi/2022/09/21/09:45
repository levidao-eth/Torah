老婆，我想你了。记得养胃，你可以做到的，
上帝与你同在。我养你，爱你。感恩有你。

“When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the Lord sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt; hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.”
‭‭Exodus‬ ‭9:23-24‬ ‭NIV‬‬
