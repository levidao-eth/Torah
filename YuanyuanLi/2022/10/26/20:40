Hear, O Israel! יהוה is our God, יהוה alone. 
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4

You shall love your God יהוה with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.5

Take to heart these instructions with which I charge you this day.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.6

Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.7

Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead; 
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.8

inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.9

If, then, you obey the commandments that I enjoin upon you this day, loving your God יהוה and serving [God] with all your heart and soul,
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.13

I will grant the rain for your land in season, the early rain and the late. You shall gather in your new grain and wine and oil—
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.14

I will also provide grass in the fields for your cattle—and thus you shall eat your fill.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.15

Take care not to be lured away to serve other gods and bow to them.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.16

For יהוה’s anger will flare up against you, shutting up the skies so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its produce; and you will soon perish from the good land that יהוה is assigning to you.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.17

Therefore impress these My words upon your very heart: bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead, 
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.18

and teach them to your children—reciting them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up;
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.19

and inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates—
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.20

to the end that you and your children may endure, in the land that יהוה swore to your fathers to assign to them, as long as there is a heaven over the earth.
https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.21

‎יהוה said to Moses as follows:
https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.37

Speak to the Israelite people and instruct them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout the ages; let them attach a cord of blue to the fringe at each corner.
https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.38

That shall be your fringe; look at it and recall all the commandments of יהוה and observe them, so that you do not follow your heart and eyes in your lustful urge.
https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.39

Thus you shall be reminded to observe all My commandments and to be holy to your God.
https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.40

I יהוה am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I, your God יהוה.
https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.41
